# Cl√©rouin Resistivity Data

This data originated from the paper: 

_A database for equations of state and resistivities measurements in the warm dense matter regime_\
J. Clerouin et al.\
Physics of Plasmas 19, 082702 (2012)

I obtained the data as this CSV file from an anonymous referee during the review process of my paper:

_Data-driven Electrical Conductivities of Dense Plasmas_\
Michael S. Murillo\
Frontiers in Physics, (2022)

Thanks to the referee, whoever you are!
