# DeSilva Data
____
This database contains data from exploding wire experiments conducted by DeSilva. Specifially, the database contains elements:
* Cu
* W
* Fe
* Al

# Modified Lee-More Model (MLM)

In the original paper [Murillo, Frontiers in Physics, 2022], a modification of the Lee-More conductivity model was used with this dataset. The MLM has been written as an easy to use library and is included here with the data.

# Files Included 

I have organized the files in different ways and have provided a Jupyter notebook that allows one to explore the data and perhaps allow the user to create customized files. These files are:
* `MLM.py` -- modified Lee-More Model
* `DeSilvaKatsouros.pdf` -- original DeSilva paper
* `Explore_DeSilva.ipynb` -- Jupyter notebook for exploring the data
* `DeSilva_combined.csv` -- data for all elements
* `Cu.csv`, `W.csv`, `Fe.csv`, `Al.csv` -- individual files for each element

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Here is what the data looks like:

Thanks to Prof. Jacob at Texas Tech and Dr. Stephanie Hansen at Sandia for the data. If you have data beyond what is here, please send it to me!
