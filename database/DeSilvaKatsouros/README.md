This database contains data from exploding wire experiments conducted by DeSilva. Specifially, the database contains elements:
* Cu
* W
* Fe
* Al

I have organized the files in different ways and have provided a Jupyter notebook that allows one to explore the data and perhaps allow the user to create customized files. These files are:
* Explore_DeSilva.ipynb
* DeSilva_combined.csv
* Cu.csv, W.csv, Fe.csv, Al.csv

Here is what the data looks like:

Thanks to Prof. Jacob at Texas Tech and Dr. Stephanie Hansen at Sandia for the data. If you have data beyond what is here, please send it to me!
